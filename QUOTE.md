##### Client: Ontraport

### Material Provided By Ontraport For Estimate

 1. *15* screens to be mocked up.
 2. *8* additional mobile centric aesthetic details screens.
 2. Image assets for each screen as applicable.
 3. Color code schemes for each screen.

### Materials Still Required From Ontraport For Estimate

 1. Access to a server where the API will be hosted (this is required to proxy information from sched.org to our app). 
 2. Darkblue color code. Currently the one provided wasn't complete (missing a byte): #17A5D

### Questions/Concerns

 1. The dropdown menu is an overlay as opposed to a push down which is generally more standard. I'd actually recommend a side-swipe activated menu as that is a more in-app feel than a ported website.
 2. In "Town Detail" page, what/where does the "View Reviews" lead too.

### Pages

 1. Login
 2. Splash
 3. Schedule
 4. Schedule Details
 5. My Schedule
 6. Speakers
 7. Speaker Details
 8. Workshops
 9. Workshop Details
 10. Around Town
 11. Location Details
 11. FAQs
